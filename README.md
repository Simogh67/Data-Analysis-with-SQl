# Data-Analysis-with-SQl
In this project, we perform some analysis on a dataset from the World Bank
that includes forest area and total land area by country and year 
from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions
to which they belong. To this end, we use SQL. 
Our finding about the dataset is presented as a PdF named Global Deforestation analysis. 
The sql code used to analize the data is stored in this repository.
